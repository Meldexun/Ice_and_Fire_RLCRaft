    For all too long we have heard
Tales of giant reptiles, both of
which are incarnations of a primal
element; fire and ice. But word has
spread of a similar creature which
lingers in only the most exotic
biomes - the lightning dragon.

Haunting the black night skies of
jungles, the lightning dragon is
nocturnal, unlike its fire and ice
cousins. The lightning dragon inhabits
roosts and underground caves full
of crackled blocks that have been
struck by lightning. Like how ice
and fire dragons have affinities for
certain gemstones, lightning dragons
love amethysts and diamonds.

Amethyst occurs deep underground
in jungles.

In addition to being found in jungles,
there are reports of lightning dragons
being spotted outside of jungles: on
top of tall mountains, in deep canyons,
in dry badlands, and even during
thunderstorms. However, these reports
have yet to be confirmed.
